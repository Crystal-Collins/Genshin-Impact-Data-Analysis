Exploratory data analysis of Genshin Impact characters.

Genshin Impact is a globally popular RPG gacha style game created by the video game developer miHoYo. Gacha refers to a toy vending machine in many parts of East Asia, and when it comes to video games the same concept applies. Players are encouraged to spend in-game currency in order to win a virtual item. miHoYo's system of character banners features a new character to excite gamers every couple of weeks. Players must use the in-game currency to "wish" for the character. This strategy is paying off, for the developers.

That being said, a large population of players are still F2P, or Free to Play. The best part about the gaming experience, for those who don't wish to spend the money, is that it is indeed free to play. I'd like to take a look at the characters of Genshin Impact that players will be using up to level 20. I'm curious if the characters that appear to be the strongest in level 1 will continue to be the strongest in level 20. I'd ultimately like to know if the strongest F2P characters will hold up to the strongest selected gacha characters.
